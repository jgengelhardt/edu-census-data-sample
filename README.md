# edu-census-data-sample

This is a record of my self-guided exploration of data in some [US census data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). I explored the questions below, asked by [Alyssa Vigil](https://discuss.codecademy.com/u/alyssavigil/summary) in her ["Data Science Independent Project #3 – Education & Census Data"](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/data-science-independent-project-3-education-census-data/419947) project on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/about):

* How many public high schools are in each zip code? in each state?
* Display the corresponding locale_text and locale_size in a query result. 
* What is the minimum, maximum, and average median_household_income of the nation? for each state?
* Do characteristics of the zip-code area, such as median household income, influence students’ performance in high school? 
* On average, do students perform better on the math or reading exam? Find the number of states where students do better on the math exam, and vice versa. 
* What is the average proficiency on state assessment exams for each zip code, and how do they compare to other zip codes in the same state?
